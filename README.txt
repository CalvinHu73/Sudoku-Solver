This is a Sudoku solver that I created over the winter break of the 2019-2020 school year.
My inspiration came from a video that talked about fun coding projects.
I watched two videos on backtracking and a tutorial on using it for Sudoku then I
coded this from what I learned.

===================
=: Core Concepts :=
===================

 1. Backtracking
		I used back tracking to solve the Sudoku board
 2. Appropriately modeling state using 2-D arrays
		I used a 8x8 array to model the chess board. 
		This is appropriate because a chess board is labeled by rows and columns.
		I can label positions of pieces with rows and columns on the board easily
		through a 8x8 2-D array
